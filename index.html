									<h2>Quick background about myself</h2>
									<p> From the beginning , I know that my strengths and talent is on analytical and mathematical area. After I graduated, I've decided to pursue a career where my talent would be fully utilized,
										and then I've heard about Data Science and it intrigued me. I've decided to study the prerequisite of it which turns out to be statistics and programming. The moment I got a hand on them, I've realized that this field is the best fit for me. Since then , 
										I did extensive studying for years and did several projects on my own. Now, with the awareness that I still have a lot of rooms for improvement, I can proudly say that I am confident about my skills and knowledge that I gained and developed so far. 
										Projects below represents the fruit of my perseverance and will serve as proofs on what I can do.</p>
