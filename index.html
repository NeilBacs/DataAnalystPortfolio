									<h2>Quick background about myself</h2>
									<p> From the beginning , I know that my strengths and talent is on analytical and mathematical area. After I graduated, I've decided to pursue a career where my talent would be fully utilized,
										and then I've heard about Data Science and it intrigued me. I've decided to study the prerequisite of it which turns out to be statistics and programming. The moment I got a hand on them, I've realized that this field is the best fit for me. Since then , 
										I did extensive studying for years and did several projects on my own. Now, with the awareness that I still have a lot of rooms for improvement, I can proudly say that I am confident about my skills and knowledge that I gained and developed so far. 
										Projects below represents the fruit of my perseverance and will serve as proofs on what I can do.</p>

										<h2>Data cleaning in spreadsheet <br> <br></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/datacleaning.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project showcases my skills in data cleaning and data integrity checking. The spreadsheet consists of three sheets: the first sheet contains the raw data,
										the second sheet demonstrates how I ensure data integrity by checking for consistencies and discrepancies,
										and the third sheet outlines the data cleaning process. The cleaned data obtained from this project will be used for the subsequent steps.

										<h2>Data exploration in SQL</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/dataexploration.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project showcases my skills in SQL. I imported the cleaned data from an Excel file into the SQL Server installed on my computer.
											It demonstrates my ability to write queries using statements, clauses, and functions, and highlights my proficiency in deriving insights from the cleaned data.
											I have documented my thought process for each query,  the file was save as a GitHub markdown file.

										<h2>Data analysis and visualization in spreadsheet </h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/analysisAndViz.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project showcases a snapshot of the visualization I created using Power BI Desktop. Unfortunately, I am unable to publish it at the moment as 
											it requires a Power BI workspace, which necessitates a corporate account. So this is just a picture of a simple  visualization that provides an overview of the insights derived from the data.
